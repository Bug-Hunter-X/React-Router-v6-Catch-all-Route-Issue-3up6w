# React Router v6 Catch-all Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes ('/*') in React Router v6.  The catch-all route, intended to handle 404 scenarios, unexpectedly intercepts all other routes, even valid ones. 

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
